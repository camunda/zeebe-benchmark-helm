## Requirements

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) >= 3.11.x
* Kubernetes >= 1.20+
* Minimum cluster requirements include the following to run this chart with default settings.
  All of these settings are configurable.
    * Three Kubernetes nodes to respect the default "hard" affinity settings
    * 2GB of RAM for the JVM heap

## Dependencies

Zeebe Benchmark Helm chart depends on the Camunda Platform 8 Helm chart, which has its own dependencies.

The dependency management is fully automated and managed by Helm itself;
however, it's good to understand the dependency structure. This third-party dependency is reflected in the Helm chart
as follows:

```
zeebe-benchmark
  |_camunda-platform
      |_ elasticsearch
      |_ identity
        |_ keycloak
          |_ postgresql
      |_ optimize
      |_ operate
      |_ tasklist
      |_ web-modeler
        |_ postgresql
      |_ zeebe
```

In the Zeebe Benchmark Helm chart, every sub-component from Camunda Platform 8 is disabled except Zeebe.
This can be changed via setting the right values.

## Installation

The first command adds the Zeebe Benchmark Helm charts repo, and the second installs the chart to your current 
Kubernetes context.

```shell
  helm repo add zeebe-benchmark https://zeebe-io.github.io/benchmark-helm/
  helm install this-is-a-benchmark zeebe-benchmark/zeebe-benchmark
```

### Local Kubernetes

We recommend using Helm on KIND for local environments, as the Helm configurations are battle-tested
and much closer to production systems.

For more details, follow the Camunda Platform 8
[local Kubernetes cluster guide](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/guides/local-kubernetes-cluster/).

## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:

```sh
helm uninstall YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

> **Note**
>
> Notice that all the Services and Pods will be deleted, but not the PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
> which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and Elasticsearch.

To free up the storage, you need to delete all the PVCs manually.

First, view the PVCs:

```sh
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
kubectl get pvc -l release=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:

```sh
kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
kubectl delete pvc -l release=YOUR_RELEASE_NAME
```

Or you can delete the related Kubernetes namespace, which contains all PVCs.

## Configuration

The following sections contain the configuration values for the chart and each sub-chart. All of them can be overwritten
via a separate `values.yaml` file.

Check out the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) file, which contains the same content and documentation.

> **Note**
> For more details about deploying Camunda Platform 8 on Kubernetes, please visit the
> [Helm/Kubernetes installation instructions docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/overview/).

### Camunda Platform

Zeebe Benchmark Helm chart has a dependency on the [Camunda 8 Platform Helm chart](https://helm.camunda.io/). All variables related to Camunda Platform can be found in [camunda-platform/values.yaml](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-helm/tree/main/charts/camunda-platform/values.yaml) and can be set under `camunda-platform`.

| Section | Parameter | Description | Default |
|-|-|-|-|
| `camunda-platform`| `enabled` | If true, enables Camunda Platform 8 deployment as part of the Helm chart | `true` |

**Example:**

```yaml
camunda-platform:
  enabled: true
```

Per default Zeebe and Zeebe-Gateway are enabled and all other components are disabled.

### Retention Policy

| | `enabled` | If true, elasticsearch curator cronjob and configuration will be deployed. | `false` |
| | `schedule` |Defines how often/when the curator should run. | `"0 * * * *"` |
| | `policies` |Defines a list of policies, which allows to specify policies for specific indexes or globally (based on the pattern specified). | `"0 * * * *"` |
| | `image` |Configuration for the elasticsearch curator cronjob. ||


### Worker

## Development

For development purposes, you might want to deploy and test the charts without creating a new helm chart release.
To do this you can run the following:

```sh
 helm install YOUR_RELEASE_NAME --atomic --debug ./charts/camunda-platform
```

* `--atomic if set, the installation process deletes the installation on failure. The --wait flag will be set automatically if --atomic is used`

* `--debug enable verbose output`

To generate the resources/manifests without really installing them, you can use:

* `--dry-run simulate an install`

If you see errors like:

```sh
Error: found in Chart.yaml, but missing in charts/ directory: elasticsearch
```

Then you need to download the dependencies first.

Run the following to add resolve the dependencies:

```sh
make helm.repos-add
```

After this, you can run: `make helm.dependency-update`, which will update and download the dependencies for all charts.

The execution should look like this:
```
$ make helm.dependency-update
helm dependency update charts/camunda-platform
